## About Me

Hey there! I'm Lokesh, an AI/ML Engineer and final-year B.Tech student at VVIT who's been obsessed with making machines smarter since that "ABSOLUTE CINEMA" moment in my third year when my ML model understood my handwriting better than I could. 

Currently building intelligent systems at the intersection of AI, cloud, and full-stack development. At Brainovision, I engineered a Django-based real-time monitoring system that achieved 89.8% uptime across 50+ industrial pumps while reducing downtime by 18%. Google Associate Cloud Engineer certified, GATE 2024 qualified (AIR 15,202), and a LeetCode warrior with 300+ problems solved.

From crafting AI agents with LangChain and CrewAI to building beautiful UIs with React and TypeScript, I've touched every part of the modern tech stack. Whether it's implementing RAG systems, fine-tuning LLMs with Unsloth, or deploying ML models in production with Docker and AWS—I'm all in. When I'm not debugging at 2 AM, you'll find me at the gym, dominating in esports, or writing creative content (like that RDR2 expansion nobody asked for but I wrote anyway).

I'm always down to collaborate on cool projects or discuss how AI is going to take over the world. Hit me up if you're building something interesting!

**Education:** B.Tech in Computer Science Engineering - AI & ML | VVIT | 2021–2025 | Guntur
