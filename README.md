## About Me

Hey there! I'm Lokesh, an AI/ML Engineer and final-year B.Tech student at VVIT who's basically been living rent-free in the intersection of artificial intelligence and questionable caffeine intake. Remember that kid who took apart their toys to see how they worked? Yeah, that's me—except now I'm taking apart neural networks at 2 AM in my college lab while everyone else is either sleeping or having a social life (what's that?).

My journey started when I accidentally made my ML model understand my chicken-scratch handwriting better than I could. That "ABSOLUTE CINEMA" moment in third year? Life-changing. Since then, I've been on a mission to make machines smarter while somehow maintaining my sanity and a gym membership (priorities, right?).

**The Highlight Reel:**
- Built a Django-based real-time monitoring system at Brainovision that reduced pump downtime by 18% and achieved 89.8% system uptime across 50+ industrial pumps (basically turned dumb pumps into Harvard graduates)
- Crushed 300+ LeetCode problems because apparently, I enjoy pain and suffering in algorithm form
- Became a Google Associate Cloud Engineer (my cloud game is stronger than my social game)
- Qualified GATE 2024 with AIR 15,202 (hey, at least I made it to the leaderboard)
- Conducted a hackathon in my branch (from participant to organizer—character development at its finest)
- Wrote an unofficial expansion for Red Dead Redemption 2 because when you're not debugging code, might as well be a creative writer

**Current Status:**
- Mastering Generative AI, RAG systems, and LLMs (LangChain, LangGraph, CrewAI—the holy trinity)
- Building full-stack applications with React, TypeScript, and whatever new framework dropped this week
- Training models that can actually understand context (unlike some people I know)
- Deploying scalable solutions with Docker, AWS, and GCP (containers > commitment, fight me)
- Writing blog posts about AI that hopefully make sense (check out "Gen AI ~ The Man-Made Creator")

**The Fun Stuff:**
When I'm not debugging at ungodly hours, you'll find me at the gym (gotta balance that desk life), dominating in esports (my K/D ratio > my GPA), strategizing over board games, or taking long walks to contemplate why my code worked yesterday but not today. I'm also that person who thinks Red Dead Redemption 2 needed more content, so I wrote some.

**Tech Arsenal:**
From building AI agents that don't suck to crafting beautiful UIs with React and Tailwind, from wrangling databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL, Redis, GraphDB) to deploying ML models in production, I've pretty much touched every part of the modern tech stack. Whether it's traditional RAG, multimodal RAG, knowledge graphs, or agentic RAG—I've implemented them all. Deep learning? Check. Transformers? Check. Fine-tuning with Unsloth? Check. Making it all work together? Still working on it.

**Project Highlights:**
- **TaskPal**: Because the world needed another task manager (but mine has AI features and actually looks good)
- **EchoVoice**: Voice journaling app where your future self can cringe at past messages
- **WiseChoice**: AI shopping assistant that tells you when you're being scammed online (you're welcome)
- **BookBurst**: For book nerds who want to flex their reading stats
- **Slack Clone with AI**: Built a Slack clone with AI integration featuring @zani assistant, tone analysis, and smart replies (because regular messaging is too mainstream)

I'm always down to collaborate on cool projects, discuss the latest in AI/ML, or debate whether tabs or spaces are superior (it's spaces, obviously). If you're building something interesting or just want to chat about how we're all going to be replaced by AI someday, hit me up!
